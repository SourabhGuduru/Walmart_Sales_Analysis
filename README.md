### Key Questions Addressed

1. Which stores have the maximum sales?
2. Which store has the maximum standard deviation, i.e., the sales vary a lot? Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation.
3. Which store(s) had a good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012?
4. Find out which holidays have higher sales than the mean sales in the non-holiday season for all stores together.
5. Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.
6. Build prediction to forecast demand
